# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Objective
To segment customers based on purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

## Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Selected `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)` as features.
   - Scaled features for normalization.

2. **Clustering**:
   - Used the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters (`k=3`).
   - Applied K-Means clustering.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plot of clusters shows clear segmentation.

## Findings
- Customers are grouped into three distinct clusters based on income and spending behavior.
- Insights can guide marketing strategies for targeted promotions.
